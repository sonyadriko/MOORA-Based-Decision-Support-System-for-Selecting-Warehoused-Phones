<h2>Background</h2>
Selecting the right phones to warehouse involves considering multiple criteria such as cost, demand, specifications, and storage requirements. The MOORA method is a multi-criteria decision-making approach that helps in evaluating and ranking options based on these criteria. This project leverages the MOORA method to simplify and improve the decision-making process for warehousing phones.
<h2>Key Features</h2>
Multi-Criteria Evaluation: Evaluates phones based on multiple criteria such as price, performance, and storage needs.
Weight Assignment: Allows users to assign weights to each criterion according to their importance.
Ranking of Options: Ranks the phones based on their overall scores calculated using the MOORA method.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for entering data and viewing results.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
PHP 8: Used for application logic and server-side processing.
MySQL: Used for storing data related to phones, criteria, and weights.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for developing the user interface.
